Shining Sapphires 1.15.2

This mod is a work in progress, but the mod is in a playable state :)

Mod for Minecraft 1.15.2 adding:
- new ores
- new biomes
- new trees with corresponding wood types and blocks like doors, stairs, fences, etc.
- new tools and armour made from new gems
- new two-block tall flower types for the new biomes

Some exciting original features:
- New tree types have a chance to generate with an "oozing" log, which has sap oozing out from it. By right-clicking it with a glass bottle, you can collect the sap! The sap is then used to craft the new gemstones!
- Armour sets that grant buffs when the whole set it worn together.
- One of the new gems, topaz, is used to augment and improve chestplates and swords - granting new properties for the equipment!

Planned features for future development:
- New mobs specific to each biome
- New dimension to encapsulate the three new biomes
- Unique tree generation for the new tree types - at present they borrow from vanilla minecraft's tree types
